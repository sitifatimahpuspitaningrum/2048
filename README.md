## 2048


## About

2048 is a fun puzzle game built with Python and Pygame. You slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine matching ones, aiming to create a 2048 tile. I made this to explore grid-based mechanics and add cool twists like themes and power-ups.


## Features
1. Slide tiles using arrow keys to merge matching numbers (like 2+2=4, 4+4=8).
2. Three themes (ocean, forest, space) with unique colors, randomly picked each game.
3. Rare power-up tiles that double your score when merged, marked with a yellow border.
4. Score tracking and win/game-over screens (win at 2048, restart with 'R' if stuck).
5. Smooth 60 FPS gameplay with clean visuals.


## How to Play
1. Use arrow keys (left, right, up, down) to slide tiles.
2. Matching tiles merge into one with double the value.
3. A new tile (usually 2, sometimes 4) spawns after each move.
4. Reach the 2048 tile to win, or keep going for a higher score!
5. If no moves are left, press 'R' to restart.
